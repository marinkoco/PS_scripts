To encrypt a PowerShell script, you can run the "EncryptScript.ps1" script and provide the path to your script file and the path where you want to save the encrypted script.

To decrypt and run an encrypted PowerShell script, you can run the "DecryptScript.ps1" script and provide the path to your encrypted script file.

Note that the "DecryptScript.ps1" script assumes that the encrypted script was encrypted using the same machine and user account that is running the script. 
If you encrypt the script using a different machine or user account, you may need to modify the decryption script to use the appropriate key for decryption.
